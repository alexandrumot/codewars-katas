# 004: Strip Comments 

Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out. 

## Example:

- Input:<br>
`apples, pears # and bananas`<br>
`grapes`<br>
`bananas !apples`<br>

- Output:<br>
`apples, pears`<br>
`grapes`<br>
`bananas`<br>
